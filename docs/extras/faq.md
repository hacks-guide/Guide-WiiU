### Does Homebrew have any risks?

Currently homebrewing the Wii U does not expose you to a risk of being banned by Nintendo unless you cheat in online games. You should, however, always be careful with launching downloaded homebrew, especially if you don't trust the source, as Homebrew can potentially damage your system!

### What is Haxchi, and do I need it?

Haxchi is a secondary entry point which uses certain DS Virtual Console titles to allow for access to homebrew while being completely offline (still works with online but no connection required to launch CFW)

Haxchi is not required, however, if you want to use homebrew on your Wii U while offline you will need it. It’s highly recommended as it’s more stable than the browser entry point, especially on the newest firmware.
