# Dumping Wii U Discs
---
Dumping your Discs allows you to install a copy of your game to the system NAND/a USB device so you can play it without needing the disc.

?> Dumping and installing games requires a working Homebrew setup, so make sure to finish the main guide on installing CFW first before following this.

!> It is **ILLEGAL** to share the files dumped with this guide.  
If you intend to use this guide to share your dumped games, don't.

### Dumping and Installing Wii U Discs {docsify-ignore}

?> Installing a game to the system memory (NAND) is not recommended as it's limited to either 8GB or 32GB depending on your model, making you run out of space pretty quickly if you want to install multiple games.  

?> When installing a game to a USB device, we recommend that you use an HDD and not a flash drive, as those are not optimized for constant reading and writing, therefore making them fail quickly. If your HDD is not externally powered, you will need a Y-cable to connect it to two USB slots on the Wii U.

!> In order to install to a USB device, it has to be formatted by the Wii U. Doing this will erase (delete) all contents (documents, pictures, videos, PC data) off of it, and prevent it from being used on another system unless you reformat it. This *does* include the vWii, meaning you will not be able to run Wii and GameCube disc images off the USB using USB loaders. To format, plug your USB HDD into the Wii U, power on your Wii U, your Wii U will prompt you to format your HDD. Confirm with Yes.
