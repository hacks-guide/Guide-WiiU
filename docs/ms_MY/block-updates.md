# Blocking Updates

All currently known Wii U exploits can, unlike e.g. the Nintendo Switch RCM exploit, be patched by a system update. Although the Wii U is no longer officially supported, Nintendo may still release updates for it. Namely, the updates 5.5.3 up to 5.5.6 were all released after the Wii U was discontinued, so blocking updates is still a recommended action.

While Aroma's PayloadLoader already has built-in update blocking functionality, it is recommended to delete the update folder to effectively block system updates.
If you get a yellow warning screen while booting into Aroma, the update folder still exists and it is recommended to delete it using the guide below.

## Instructions

Currently, one way exists to effectively block updates on the Wii U system:

1. Make sure you have the latest Aroma beta.
2. Boot into Aroma.
    - If you got the yellow warning screen, press X to block updates.
    - If you didn't get the warning, but the AutobootMenu says "Updates not blocked!", press and hold + (Plus) **and** - (Minus) at the same time until it says they are blocked.
