    - If your Wii U gets stuck on a white or otherwise frozen screen, wait a few seconds. If nothing happens, reboot the console, [reset the browser's save data](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history) and try again.
    - If you see the EnvironmentLoader, you did not hold down B long enough. Try again.

::: tip

If you get any errors like FSOpenfile failed, FSGetMountSource failed, or SD Mount failed, refer to the browser errors in [Common Issues and Fixes](../common-issues-fixes).
