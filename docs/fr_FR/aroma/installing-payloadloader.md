# Installing PayloadLoader

Now that you have your NAND backup in case anything goes wrong later, you can install the PayloadLoader on your system.

Installing the PayloadLoader will let you access Aroma just by running the Health and Safety Information app.

::: danger

A factory reset **won't** uninstall the injected PayloadLoader. Follow [uninstall PayloadLoader](../uninstall-payloadloader) to remove the PayloadLoader.
