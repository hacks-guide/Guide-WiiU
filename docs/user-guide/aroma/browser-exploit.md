## Browser Exploit

Make sure your Wii U has internet access for this step.

### Instructions

1. Take the SD Card out of your computer and plug it into your Wii U console.
1. Launch the Internet Browser and navigate to the website `wiiuexploit.xyz`.
1. Click on `Run Exploit!` and hold the B button until you see a screen that says `Please choose your payload:`, this will be necessary for the next steps.
    - If your Wii U gets stuck on a white or otherwise frozen screen, wait a few seconds. If nothing happens, reboot the console, [reset the browser's save data](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history) and try again.
    - If you see the EnvironmentLoader, you did not hold down B long enough. Try again.
