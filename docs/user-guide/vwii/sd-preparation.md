## SD Preparations

This page will guide you through the process of modding your vWii.

We will now start by placing the required Homebrew files on the SD Card.

?> **Notice**
    Your SD Card will need to be formatted as FAT32. If your SD Card is not formatted to FAT32, use [GUIFormat](http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) with 32k (32768) Allocation unit size to format it. **Do not** label the SD Card as `wiiu` or it will cause issues with homebrew.
    
?> If you have hacked your Wii U in the past, you can use the same SD Card for this process.

?> Unlike Wii U homebrew, vWii apps go in a separate `apps` folder on the root. Compat Installer is the **only** Wii U app here. 

### What You Need

- The latest files from [Aroma for your caf√©](https://aroma.foryour.cafe).
    - Click on `Download Payloads` and `Download Base Aroma`.
    - Read through the steps and click on the checkboxes.
    - If you have already installed Aroma, you do not need to redownload it.
