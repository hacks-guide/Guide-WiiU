## Installing PayloadLoader

Now that you have your NAND backup in case anything goes wrong later, you can install the PayloadLoader on your system.

Installing the PayloadLoader will let you access Tiramisu just by running the Health and Safety Information app.

!> A factory reset **won't** uninstall the injected PayloadLoader. Follow [uninstall PayloadLoader](../../uninstall-payloadloader) to remove the PayloadLoader. 

### Instructions

?> If you're already booted into Tiramisu, restart your console before executing the browser exploit again.

1. Take the SD Card out of your PC and plug it into your Wii U.

1. Navigate the list using the D-Pad and navigate to the `installer` environment, press A to launch it.
1. Press the A button to check if you can install the PayloadLoader.
    - It should now tell you that the PayloadLoader can be installed onto the Health and Safety Information app.
1. Press the A button to select `Install / Update`.
1. You'll be asked if you are sure you want to install the PayloadLoader. Use the D-Pad to select `Install` and press A.
