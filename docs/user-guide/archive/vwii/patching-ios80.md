## Patching IOS 80 (Optional)

Patching IOS 80 allows you to have custom channels on the SD card, including wads. However, it is not required.

!> If for any reason, the Wii U is turned off while patching IOS 80, your vWii will be bricked. This can be fixed by either extracting the IOS 80 from your previously made NAND backup and then replacing it over FTP or by [reinstalling IOS 80](../../recover-vwii-ioses-channels).

1. Launch Patched IOS 80 Installer for vWii.
1. Read the warning screen and wait 30 seconds.
1. Press any buttons to install.
1. Wait until it says <code>IOS80 <wbr>Installation <wbr>is <wbr>complete!</code>.
1. Press any button to exit.

!> Installing a custom System Menu is a definite brick risk and you should always have an effective backup before installing one but when done right, won't brick the vWii.

!> Installing any IOS (including TED IOSes) or wads made for the original Wii on your vWii will brick it. WiiWare wads are fine, but some need to be converted to work.
