## SD Preparations

This page will guide you through the process of modding your vWii.

We will now start by placing the required Homebrew files on the SD Card.

?> **Notice**
    Your SD Card will need to be formatted as FAT32. If your SD Card is not formatted to FAT32, use [GUIFormat](http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) with 32k (32768) Allocation unit size to format it. **Do not** label the SD Card as `wiiu` or it will cause issues with homebrew.
    
?> If you have hacked your Wii U in the past, you can use the same SD Card for this process.
