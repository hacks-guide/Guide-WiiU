## SD Preparation

We will now place the required Aroma files on the SD Card.

?> **Notice** Your SD Card will need to be formatted as FAT32. If your SD Card is not formatted to FAT32, use [GUIFormat](http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) with 32k (32768) allocation unit size to format it.  
**Do not** label the SD Card as `wiiu` or it will cause issues with homebrew.
