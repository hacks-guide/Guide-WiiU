### Pretendo Network

Pretendo is a replacement service for the Nintendo Network, which brings back online services as they are set to be discontinued. It also revives the Miiverse service, via juxtaposition. The official guide can be found [here](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/wiiu).

### Booting Tiramisu (optional)

?> Tiramisu is now archived, and was succeeded by Aroma and considered outdated. No more Homebrew will be developed for it, and services like Pretendo have ended support for it.

However, if you find the need to boot into Tiramisu, for example, to use a legacy Homebrew app, do the following:

1. Download the latest files from [Tiramisu for your caf√©](https://tiramisu.foryour.cafe).
1. Copy the `wiiu` folder to the root of your SD Card.
    - The folder should merge with the existing `wiiu` folder if not done automatically.
1. Togli la scheda SD dal computer e inseriscila nella console Wii U.
1. Start the EnvironmentLoader.
    - If you're autobooting into it, this can be done by powering on your console and holding X.
    - You do not need to reinstall the PayloadLoader if you already did so with Aroma.
1. Highlight the entry called `tiramisu` using the D-Pad.
1. Launch Tiramisu by pressing A.
1. Launch the Wii U Menu by pressing A.
    - To make the console autoboot the Wii U Menu when loading the Tiramisu environment, press Y.
1. Homebrew Launcher can be loaded by launching the Mii Maker app.
