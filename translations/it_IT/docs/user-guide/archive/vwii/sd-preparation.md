# vWii Modding Guide {docsify-ignore-all}

---&#x20;

## SD Preparations

Questa pagina ti guiderà nel processo di modding del tuo vWii.

We will now start by placing the required Homebrew files on the SD Card.

?> **Notice**
Your SD Card will need to be formatted as FAT32. If your SD Card is not formatted to FAT32, use [GUIFormat](http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) with 32k (32768) Allocation unit size to format it. **Do not** label the SD Card as `wiiu` or it will cause issues with homebrew.

?> If you have hacked your Wii U in the past, you can use the same SD Card for this process.

?> Unlike Wii U homebrew, vWii apps go in a separate `apps` folder on the root. Compat Installer is the **only** Wii U app here.
