## 启动 CFW {docsify-ignore}

现在你应该有了你主机的 NAND 备份了，所以如果你之后遇到了任何错误你都可以使用 CFW 直接恢复。

Unlike systems such as the DSi, Wii, or 3DS, Wii U CFW is temporary. This means that as soon as your system reboots, you will lose CFW and have to follow these instructions again. This can be skipped by installing CBHC to a Haxchi CFW installation.

### 操作步骤

?> If the install fails for some reason, try uninstalling and redownloading the DS VC game from the eShop and make sure it is being installed to the NAND.

1. 将内存卡从电脑上拔出并插回 Wii U。
1. If you haven't already, now download your DS VC game of choice from the eShop.
1. Launch the Homebrew Launcher on your system as [previously explained](browser-exploit).
1. Navigate the Homebrew Launcher and open the Haxchi app.
1. Use the DPAD to navigate the cursor to the game you want to install Haxchi to and press the A button to install it.
1. Once the installation has finished, your console will launch the Wii U Menu. You will see your game replaced by a Haxchi icon.
1. Run the modified DS game. This will reboot the console and enable CFW.
1. You will need to run your Haxchi DS game every reboot to launch CFW.
1. You can now re-attach any USB devices you had attached before starting the guide.
