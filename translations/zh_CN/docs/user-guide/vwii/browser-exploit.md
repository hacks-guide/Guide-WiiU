# 浏览器漏洞
---
To install the Homebrew Channel, we first need to create a NAND backup and be able to launch the Homebrew Launcher through an exploit, such as the Browser Exploit.

请确保你的 Wii U 在做到这里之前可以连接到互联网。

### 步骤 {docsify-ignore}

1. Launch an exploit of your choice:
    - If you've never run homebrew before, "launching the exploit" means run the Browser Exploit. To run the Browser Exploit launch the Internet Browser and navigate to the website `wiiuexploit.xyz`, then click on `Run Homebrew Launcher!`
        - 如果你的 Wii U 卡住不动或白屏了，请等一会。 如果什么都没有发生，那就重启主机后[重置浏览器保存的数据](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history)，然后再来一次。

    - If you're coldbooting into the PayloadLoader, "launching the exploit" means booting your console.

    - If you're launching into the PayloadLoader via the Health & Safety application, "launching the exploit" means launching the Health & Safety Application.

1. While launching the exploit of your choice, hold either the B button (if you're following the `NAND Backup` section) or the X button (if you're following the `Installing the Homebrew Channel` section).
