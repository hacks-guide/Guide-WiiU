# 选择一个 CFW
---
?> 在开始之前，你需要将你的 Wii U 更新至最新版本（欧版机为 5.5.4，其他区域的为 5.5.3）。

There are two main CFWs: Haxchi/ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC) or Mocha.  
Haxchi/CBHC are both injected into a paid DS VC game, while Mocha is only used with the web browser exploit and Indexiine, which makes it the only free CFW.

## Haxchi

- Requires a legitimately installed paid DS VC game from the eShop.
- Can be used to launch CFW directly from the Wii U Menu.
- Needs to be re-launched from the Wii U Menu every reboot to enable CFW.
- Its functionality can be extended by installing ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC) to a Haxchi installation.

## CBHC

!> Installing CBHC incorrectly can brick your Wii U! Make sure to follow the following rules when installing CBHC: <br>- The DS game has to be legitimately installed from the eShop! <br>- 安装完 CBHC 之后不要初始化系统！ <br>- Don't delete the user account that bought the DS VC game! <br>- 不要在 WUP Installer 或 eShop 中再次安装使用的同一游戏！ <br>- 不要通过 CBHC 安装 Haxchi！ <br>- Don't uninstall the DS Virtual Console game without [properly uninstalling CBHC first](uninstall-cbhc)! <br>- 不要将使用的 DS VC 游戏移动到 USB 设备中！

!> Breaking one of the above rules **will** result in a brick!

- Requires a legitimately installed paid DS VC game from the eShop.

## Mocha

- Does not require any game, and is therefore free.
- Needs to be re-launched through the browser exploit every reboot to enable CFW.
- Is not compatible with the Homebrew Launcher Channel.
- May require an Internet connection depending on what entry point you choose.
