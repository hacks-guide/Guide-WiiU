### Er det noen risikoer ved å bruke homebrew?

For øyeblikket er det ingen risiko for å bli banned av Nintendo ved bruk av homebrew med mindre du jukser i online spill. Men du bør alltid være forsiktig med å kjøre nedlastede homebrew filer, spesielt hvis du ikke stoler på kilden, da Homebrew kan potensielt skade systemet ditt!

### Hva er Haxchi, og trenger jeg det?

Haxchi er et sekundært inngangspunkt som bruker visse DS Virtual Console titler til å gi tilgang til homebrew uten å være koblet til internett (det fungerer fortsatt online, men trenger ikke tilkobling for å starte CFW)

Haxchi is not required, however, if you want to use homebrew on your Wii U while offline you will need it. It’s highly recommended as it’s more stable than the browser entry point, especially on the newest firmware.
