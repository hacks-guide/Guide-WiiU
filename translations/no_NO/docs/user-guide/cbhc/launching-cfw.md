# CBHC

## Start CFW {docsify-ignore}

Nå som du har en NAND backup i tilfelle noe går galt senere, kan du kjøre CFW på systemet ditt.

I motsetning til systemer som DSi, Wii eller 3DS, er Wii U CFW midlertidig. Dette betyr at så snart systemet starter på nytt, vil du miste CFW og må følge disse instruksjonene igjen. Det trenger du ikke ved å installere CBHC på en Haxchi CFW installasjon.

!> Installing CBHC incorrectly can brick your Wii U. Make sure to follow the following rules when installing CBHC: <br>- The DS game has to be legitimately installed from the eShop <br>- Don't format the system while CBHC is installed <br>- Don't delete the user account that bought the DS VC game <br>- Don't re-install the same game using WUP Installer or from the eShop <br>- Don't install Haxchi over CBHC <br>- Don't uninstall the DS Virtual Console game without [properly uninstalling CBHC first](../uninstall-cbhc) <br>- Don't move the DS Virtual Console game to a USB drive

!> Breaking one of the above rules will result in a brick.
