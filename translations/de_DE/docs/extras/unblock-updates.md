1. Download and extract [ftpiiu_everywhere](http://wiiubru.com/appstore/zips/fpiiu-cbhc.zip) to the root of your SD Card.
1. Download an FTP client of your choice such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1).
1. Plug the SD Card into your Wii U console and power it on.
1. Launch the CFW of your choice (Mocha, Haxchi/CBHC) and enter the Homebrew Launcher.
1. Navigate the Homebrew Launcher and run the ftpiiu_everywhere app.
1. Take note of the IP address on the Wii U screen.
1. On your PC run your preferred FTP client and open an FTP connection to your Wii U. In FileZilla, this can be done using the Site Manager, but be sure to replace the IP address with the one shown on your Wii U screen: <br><img src="docs/assets/img/FTP.png" alt="FileZilla" />
