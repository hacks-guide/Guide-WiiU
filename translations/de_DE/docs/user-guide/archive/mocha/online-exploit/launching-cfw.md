## Launching CFW {docsify-ignore}

Now that you have your NAND backup in case anything goes wrong later, you can run CFW on your system.

Unlike systems such as the DSi, Wii, or 3DS, Wii U CFW is temporary. This means that as soon as your system reboots, you will lose CFW and have to follow these instructions again. This can be skipped by installing CBHC to a Haxchi CFW installation.

### Instructions {docsify-ignore}

1. Take the SD Card out of your PC and plug it into your Wii U.
1. Launch the Homebrew Launcher on your system as [previously explained](browser-exploit).
1. Navigate the Homebrew Launcher and open the Mocha CFW app.
1. It will take you back to the Homebrew Launcher and enable CFW.
1. You will need to re-do these steps every reboot to launch CFW.
