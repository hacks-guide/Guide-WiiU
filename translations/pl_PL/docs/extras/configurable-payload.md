# Configurable Payload
---
This payload is configurable, similar to Haxchi's configuration. This could be very useful for Mocha users, as it saves a bit of time having to launch Mocha through the Homebrew Launcher.

### What You Need {docsify-ignore}

- The <a href="docs/files/Configurable_Payload.zip" download>configurable payload</a>.
- The latest release of [The Homebrew Launcher Channel](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/homebrew_launcher/releases/tag/v2.1_fix).

### Instructions {docsify-ignore}

1. Extract the `homebrew_launcher_channel.v2.1_fix.zip` file to the `install` folder on the root of your SD Card.
1. Place the SD Card into your Wii U and launch the [Homebrew Launcher](mocha/online-exploit/browser-exploit).
1. Navigate the Homebrew Launcher and launch the WUP Installer GX2 application.
1. Select `Homebrew Launcher Channel`. Press `Install` and install to NAND as the installation destination. This will install the Homebrew Launcher Channel to the Wii U Menu.
1. Once the process is finished, press the HOME Button until you're back at the Wii U Menu.
1. At this point the channel will not launch as it will conflict with the version running on SD Card you were just using. Restart the Wii U.
1. Eject the SD Card from your Wii U and insert it into your computer.
1. Extract the `Configurable_Payload.zip` file to the root of your SD Card. If it prompts you to overwrite the files on your SD Card, do so.
1. Place the SD Card into your Wii U and launch the Internet Browser and navigate to the website `wiiuexploit.xyz`.
1. Click on `Run Homebrew Launcher!`. If everything has been done correctly, you should be taken back to the Wii U Menu. Mocha has now been enabled and you can use the Homebrew Launcher Channel you installed earlier.
    - If your Wii U gets stuck on a white or otherwise frozen screen, wait a few seconds. If nothing happens, reboot the console, [reset the browser's save data](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history) and try again.
