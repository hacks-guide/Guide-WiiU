## Installing PayloadLoader {docsify-ignore}

Now that you have your NAND backup in case anything goes wrong later, you can install the PayloadLoader on your system.

Installing the PayloadLoader will let you access Tiramisu just by running the Health and Safety Information app.

!> A factory reset **won't** uninstall the injected PayloadLoader. Follow [uninstall PayloadLoader](../../uninstall-payloadloader) to remove the PayloadLoader.

### Instructions {docsify-ignore}

1. Take the SD Card out of your PC and plug it into your Wii U.
1. Execute the web browser exploit as [previously explained](browser-exploit) but this time, you will need to hold the X button to open the Environment Loader menu.
1. Navigate the list using the D-Pad and navigate to the `installer` environment, press A to launch it.
1. Press the A button to check if you can install the PayloadLoader. It should now tell you what app the PayloadLoader can be installed onto.
1. Press the A button to select `Install / Update`
1. You'll be asked if you are sure you want to install the PayloadLoader. Use the D-Pad to select `Install` and press A.

!> If you do not wish to autoboot Tiramisu on your console, you can skip the `Autobooting Tiramisu` part. </br> But you need to be aware that system updates won't be blocked and will need to be blocked by following [this guide](../block-updates). This is not required but it's highly recommended.
