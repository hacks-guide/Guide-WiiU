# Mocha - Online Exploit

## SD Preparation {docsify-ignore}

We will now place the required CFW files and some additional homebrew files on the SD Card.

?> **Notice** Your SD Card will need to be formatted as FAT32. If your SD Card is not formatted to FAT32, use [GUIFormat](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) with 32k (32768) Allocation unit size to format it. It is advised that you do not label the SD Card as `wiiu` as it may cause issues with some applications.
