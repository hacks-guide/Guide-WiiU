# Dumping Wii U Discs
---
Dumping your Discs allows you to install a copy of your game to the system NAND/a USB device so you can play it without needing the disc.

?> Dumping and installing games requires a working Homebrew setup, so make sure to finish the main guide on installing CFW first before following this.

#### **Install To USB**

### Install To USB

?> When installing a game to a USB device, we recommend that you use an HDD and not a flash drive, as those are not optimized for constant reading and writing, therefore making them fail quickly. If your HDD is not externally powered, you will need a Y-cable to connect it to two USB slots on the Wii U.

!> In order to install to a USB device, it has to be formatted by the Wii U. Doing this will erase all contents of it, and prevent it from being used on another system unless you reformat it.

### What You Need {docsify-ignore}

- Your SD Card needs to have enough space to fit the game you want to dump.
- A USB HDD (+ a Y-cable if needed)
- The latest release of [WUP Installer GX2](http://wiiubru.com/appstore/zips/wup_installer_gx2.zip)
