# Browser Exploit
---
To install the Homebrew Channel, we first need to create a NAND backup and be able to launch the Homebrew Launcher through an exploit, such as the Browser Exploit.

Make sure your Wii U has internet access for this step.

### Instructions {docsify-ignore}

1. Launch an exploit of your choice:
    - If you've never run homebrew before, "launching the exploit" means run the Browser Exploit. To run the Browser Exploit launch the Internet Browser and navigate to the website `wiiuexploit.xyz`, then click on `Run Homebrew Launcher!`
        - If your Wii U gets stuck on a white or otherwise frozen screen, wait a few seconds. If nothing happens, reboot the console, [reset the browser's save data](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history) and try again.

    - If you're coldbooting into the PayloadLoader, "launching the exploit" means booting your console.

    - If you're launching into the PayloadLoader via the Health & Safety application, "launching the exploit" means launching the Health & Safety Application.

1. While launching the exploit of your choice, hold either the B button (if you're following the `NAND Backup` section) or the X button (if you're following the `Installing the Homebrew Channel` section).
