# Choose The CFW You Want
---
?> Before starting, make sure to update your Wii U console to the latest firmware (5.5.4 for European consoles, 5.5.3 for all other regions) if you haven't already.

There are two main CFWs: Haxchi/ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC) or Mocha.  
Haxchi/CBHC are both injected into a paid DS VC game, while Mocha is only used with the web browser exploit and Indexiine, which makes it the only free CFW.

## Haxchi

- Requires a legitimately installed paid DS VC game from the eShop.
- Can be used to launch CFW directly from the Wii U Menu.
- Needs to be re-launched from the Wii U Menu every reboot to enable CFW.
- Its functionality can be extended by installing ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC) to a Haxchi installation.

## CBHC

!> Installing CBHC incorrectly can brick your Wii U! Make sure to follow the following rules when installing CBHC: <br>- The DS game has to be legitimately installed from the eShop! <br>- Don't format the system while CBHC is installed! <br>- Don't delete the user account that bought the DS VC game! <br>- Don't re-install the same game using WUP Installer or from the eShop! <br>- Don't install Haxchi over CBHC! <br>- Don't uninstall the DS Virtual Console game without [properly uninstalling CBHC first](uninstall-cbhc)! <br>- Don't move the DS Virtual Console game to a USB drive!

!> Breaking one of the above rules **will** result in a brick!

- Requires a legitimately installed paid DS VC game from the eShop.
- Automatically launches CFW on every boot.

## Mocha

- Does not require any game, and is therefore free.
- Needs to be re-launched through the browser exploit every reboot to enable CFW.
- Is not compatible with the Homebrew Launcher Channel.
- May require an Internet connection depending on what entry point you choose.
