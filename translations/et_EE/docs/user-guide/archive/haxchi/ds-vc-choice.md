## Choose Your DS VC Game

The first thing to decide is what DS Virtual Console (usually abbreviated as "VC") game you will buy.  
Please note that the game you injected Haxchi/CBHC into will not be playable anymore until you uninstall Haxchi/CBHC and reinstall the game from the eShop.

### Compatible DS VC Games
