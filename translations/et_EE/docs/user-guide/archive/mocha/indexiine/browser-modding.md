**CURRENT METHOD IS AVAILABLE [HERE](../../../introduction)**

## Internet Browser Modding {docsify-ignore}

Now that you have your NAND backup in case anything goes wrong later, you can install Indexiine on your system.

?> In case you haven't plugged your SD Card back into your Wii U after copying your NAND backup to a computer, do so now.


### Instructions {docsify-ignore}

1. Turn on your Wii U.
1. Launch the internet browser and open the website `wiiuexploit.xyz`.
1. Click on `Run Homebrew Launcher!`. Your console should launch the Homebrew Launcher.
    - If your Wii U gets stuck on a white or otherwise frozen screen, wait a few seconds. If nothing happens, reboot the console, [reset the browser's save data](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history) and try again.
1. Navigate through the Homebrew Launcher and launch the `Indexiine Installer` app.
1. Press the A button to install Indexiine.
1. When the process completed, close the Homebrew Launcher to get back to your Wii U menu.

The Homebrew Launcher will now be launched every time you launch the Internet Browser even without an internet connection. If you want to visit another website, open it before Indexiine triggers the exploit.

?> In case you ever want to uninstall Indexiine, see the [Uninstall Indexiine](../../uninstall-indexiine) page
